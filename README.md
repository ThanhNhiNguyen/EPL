The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize key performance metrics of selected English Premier League (EPL) teams—Liverpool, Arsenal, Nottingham Forest, and Newcastle United—for the 2024-2025 season. The research aims to answer several questions: Which players have the highest goal contributions (goals and assists) in each team? How do the selected teams compare in terms of match outcomes, including wins, losses, and draws? What are the defensive strengths of each team, as indicated by metrics such as tackles and interceptions?<img width="468" height="199" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f516e8c-16e3-4779-a0a5-3b4bbf6e4c04" />
